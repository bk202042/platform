### 1. Supabase Security & Database Analysis

*   **Initial Security Audit**: I began by running a comprehensive security analysis on your Supabase project ("bayfront"), which identified several vulnerabilities.
*   **RLS Policy Remediation**:
    *   Addressed a critical issue where the `item` table had Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled but no policies defined. I created a default policy to secure it.
    *   Corrected the `INSERT` policies for the `community_posts`, `community_comments`, and `community_likes` tables. They were incorrectly using a `USING` clause, which I replaced with the correct `WITH CHECK` clause to allow authenticated users to create new entries.
*   **View and Function Security**:
    *   Recreated the `secure_spatial_ref_sys` view to remove the insecure `SECURITY DEFINER` property.
    *   Systematically fixed the search paths for numerous database functions to prevent potential security risks.
*   **Provided Manual Guidance**: For security settings that cannot be changed via the API (OTP expiry and leaked password protection), I provided you with clear, step-by-step instructions to update them in your Supabase project dashboard.

### 2. Codebase & Schema Integrity Improvements

*   **Database Schema Alignment**: I resolved the critical mismatch between your application code and the database schema. This involved creating and applying a series of database migrations to:
    *   Properly establish the `cities` table.
    *   Restructure the `apartments` table to use a `city_id` foreign key, aligning it with the application's data-fetching logic.
*   **Standardized Data Fetching**: I refactored the `getComments` function in `lib/data/community.ts` to fetch user information from the `public.profiles` table instead of the `auth.users` table. This ensures that user profile data is sourced consistently across the application.
*   **Enhanced Frontend Error Handling**: I improved the user experience in the community section by updating the `NewPostDialog.client.tsx` component. It now displays specific, meaningful error messages from the API and uses toast notifications, replacing the previous generic "network error" message.
*   **Consolidated Validation Logic**: To improve maintainability and reduce code duplication, I refactored the comment deletion API endpoint to use the centralized `validateCommentDeletion` helper function, ensuring that validation logic is consistent and managed in a single place.
