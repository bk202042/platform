- **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the file structure, the most relevant files for this task are likely:

  - `app/api/request-info/route.ts`: This is the API endpoint that would likely handle sending emails using Resend.
  - `app/emails/RequestInfoEmail.tsx`: This is the React component for the email template used by Resend.
  - Components that handle user input forms, particularly those related to "request info". Looking at the file tree, `app/(main)/properties/[id]/_components/RequestInfoForm.tsx` seems like a prime candidate for using React Hook Form to capture user input for a request.
  - Validation schemas in `lib/validation/` that might be used with React Hook Form, specifically `lib/validation/request-info.ts`.
  - Any other form components in the `components/` directory that might use React Hook Form (e.g., sign-in, sign-up forms in `app/auth/`).

- **Read File Contents:** Use the `read_file` tool to read the contents of the identified files. This will provide the actual code implementation details.

- **Analyze Code:** Examine the code in the read files to understand:

  - How React Hook Form is implemented in the form components (e.g., `useForm` hook, form state, input registration, submission handling).
  - How validation (likely using Zod with React Hook Form) is set up.
  - How the form data is sent to the backend (likely via a `fetch` call to the `/api/request-info` endpoint).
  - How the `/api/request-info/route.ts` handler receives and processes the data.
  - How Resend is initialized and used to send emails in the API route handler.
  - How the `RequestInfoEmail.tsx` component is used as the email body.

- **Extract Key Information:** Identify the core concepts and implementation details related to React Hook Form and Resend usage. This includes:

  - Specific hooks and functions used from `react-hook-form`.
  - Validation library and schema used.
  - API endpoint URL for sending emails.
  - Resend API key usage (likely from environment variables).
  - Resend `send` function parameters.
  - Structure of the email data being sent.

- **Create Memory Entities and Relations:** Use the `create_entities` and `create_relations` tools from the `memory` MCP server to store this information in the knowledge graph. Potential entities could include:

  - "React Hook Form" (EntityType: Library)
  - "Resend" (EntityType: Service)
  - "RequestInfoForm Component" (EntityType: Component)
  - "RequestInfo API Route" (EntityType: API Endpoint)
  - "RequestInfoEmail Template" (EntityType: Component)
  - "RequestInfo Validation Schema" (EntityType: Schema)

  Relations could include:

  - "RequestInfoForm Component" "uses" "React Hook Form"
  - "RequestInfoForm Component" "sends data to" "RequestInfo API Route"
  - "RequestInfo API Route" "uses" "Resend"
  - "RequestInfo API Route" "uses" "RequestInfoEmail Template"
  - "RequestInfoForm Component" "uses" "RequestInfo Validation Schema"

  Observations for each entity would include the specific implementation details and code snippets found in the files.

- **Confirm Completion:** Once the entities and relations are created in memory, the task is complete.

## Implementation of Email Notification and Toast Alerts for Agent Registration

### 1. Email Sending with Resend

- Updated the agent registration API endpoint (`/app/api/agents/register/route.ts`) to include Resend email functionality
- Added code to send emails after successful form submission:

```typescript
// Send email notification
try {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: "VinaHome <admin@bkmind.com>",
    to: ["admin@bkmind.com"],
    cc: [agentData.email],
    subject: "New Agent Registration",
    react: AgentRegistrationEmail(agentData),
  });
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error("Error sending email notification:", emailError);
  // Continue with success response even if email fails
}
```

- Integrated with the existing `AgentRegistrationEmail` component to format the email content
- Implemented error handling for email sending that doesn't affect user experience if email fails

### 2. Toast Notifications with Sonner

- Added Sonner toast notifications to the agent registration form (`/app/join-as-agent/_components/AgentRegistrationForm.tsx`)
- Implemented success notifications:

```typescript
toast.success(
  "Your agent registration has been submitted! We will contact you soon.",
);
```

- Added error notifications with specific error messages:

```typescript
toast.error(
  err instanceof Error
    ? err.message
    : "Something went wrong with your submission.",
);
```

- Toast notifications appear immediately after form submission, providing instant feedback

### 3. Consistent User Experience

- Created a dedicated success page (`/app/join-as-agent/success/page.tsx`) to handle redirects after successful form submission
- Added layout consistency with a shared layout file (`/app/join-as-agent/layout.tsx`)
- Implemented form state management using React's useState to track submission status
- Used proper error handling to display descriptive error messages

### 4. Project Structure and Type Safety

- Ensured proper TypeScript typing throughout the implementation
- Matched the email sending pattern used in the request-info API endpoint for consistency
- Fixed type errors for better type safety in the API endpoint
- Implemented defensive error handling to prevent uncaught exceptions

This implementation provides users with immediate feedback via toast notifications and sends detailed email notifications to administrators when new agent registrations are submitted, enhancing both user experience and administrative workflow.
