- __Identify Relevant Files:__ Based on the file structure, the most relevant files for this task are likely:

  - `app/api/request-info/route.ts`: This is the API endpoint that would likely handle sending emails using Resend.
  - `app/emails/RequestInfoEmail.tsx`: This is the React component for the email template used by Resend.
  - Components that handle user input forms, particularly those related to "request info". Looking at the file tree, `app/(main)/properties/[id]/_components/RequestInfoForm.tsx` seems like a prime candidate for using React Hook Form to capture user input for a request.
  - Validation schemas in `lib/validation/` that might be used with React Hook Form, specifically `lib/validation/request-info.ts`.
  - Any other form components in the `components/` directory that might use React Hook Form (e.g., sign-in, sign-up forms in `app/auth/`).

- __Read File Contents:__ Use the `read_file` tool to read the contents of the identified files. This will provide the actual code implementation details.

- __Analyze Code:__ Examine the code in the read files to understand:

  - How React Hook Form is implemented in the form components (e.g., `useForm` hook, form state, input registration, submission handling).
  - How validation (likely using Zod with React Hook Form) is set up.
  - How the form data is sent to the backend (likely via a `fetch` call to the `/api/request-info` endpoint).
  - How the `/api/request-info/route.ts` handler receives and processes the data.
  - How Resend is initialized and used to send emails in the API route handler.
  - How the `RequestInfoEmail.tsx` component is used as the email body.

- __Extract Key Information:__ Identify the core concepts and implementation details related to React Hook Form and Resend usage. This includes:

  - Specific hooks and functions used from `react-hook-form`.
  - Validation library and schema used.
  - API endpoint URL for sending emails.
  - Resend API key usage (likely from environment variables).
  - Resend `send` function parameters.
  - Structure of the email data being sent.

- __Create Memory Entities and Relations:__ Use the `create_entities` and `create_relations` tools from the `memory` MCP server to store this information in the knowledge graph. Potential entities could include:

  - "React Hook Form" (EntityType: Library)
  - "Resend" (EntityType: Service)
  - "RequestInfoForm Component" (EntityType: Component)
  - "RequestInfo API Route" (EntityType: API Endpoint)
  - "RequestInfoEmail Template" (EntityType: Component)
  - "RequestInfo Validation Schema" (EntityType: Schema)

  Relations could include:

  - "RequestInfoForm Component" "uses" "React Hook Form"
  - "RequestInfoForm Component" "sends data to" "RequestInfo API Route"
  - "RequestInfo API Route" "uses" "Resend"
  - "RequestInfo API Route" "uses" "RequestInfoEmail Template"
  - "RequestInfoForm Component" "uses" "RequestInfo Validation Schema"

  Observations for each entity would include the specific implementation details and code snippets found in the files.

- __Confirm Completion:__ Once the entities and relations are created in memory, the task is complete.
