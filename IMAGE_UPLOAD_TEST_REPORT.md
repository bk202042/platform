# Community Image Upload Functionality Test Report

## Test Overview
This report documents the testing of image upload functionality in the community section using Playwright automation. The testing focused on the user journey for creating posts with image uploads and monitoring the upload process logs.

## Test Environment
- **URL Tested**: http://localhost:3000/community
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Test Date**: 2025-07-31
- **Development Server**: Next.js 15.3.1 running on localhost:3000

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Successfully Tested Features

   - The "Í∏ÄÏì∞Í∏∞" (Write Post) button successfully opens the post creation modal
   - Modal appears with proper dialog structure

2. **Apartment Selection Dropdown**
   - Dropdown opens and displays available apartments including:
     - Ìò∏ÏπòÎØº, Masteri Thao Dien
     - ÌïòÎÖ∏Ïù¥, Keang Nam Landmark 72
     - Ìò∏ÏπòÎØº, Landmark 81
     - And 25+ other Vietnamese apartment complexes

3. **Image Upload Area Display**

     - Apartment selection (required)
     - Category selection (required)
     - Title (optional)
     - Content (required)
     - Image upload (optional, max 5 files)

5. **Existing Posts Verification**
   - Found evidence of previous successful image uploads:
     - "ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏ Ïù¥ÎØ∏ÏßÄ" post by dearjm04
     - "ÏÇ¨ÏßÑ ÏóÖÎ°úÎìú ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏" post by dearjm04
   - These posts indicate the upload functionality has been working

6. **Console Logging Setup**
   - Successfully configured console monitoring for upload logs
   - Ready to capture custom logging messages with emojis (üîÑ, üìÅ, üöÄ, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üìä)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered

1. **Authentication Requirement**
   - Cannot complete full post creation without proper authentication
   - Login credentials provided (dearjm04@naver.com / bk223978) resulted in "Invalid login credentials"
   - Google OAuth redirect encountered but cannot complete without actual Google account access

2. **Selector Specificity Issues**
   - Multiple elements with same text ("Ïπ¥ÌÖåÍ≥†Î¶¨") caused test failures
   - Need more specific selectors for reliable testing

3. **Form Submission Timeout**
   - Some form interactions timeout without authentication
   - Cannot complete full upload flow simulation

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

1. **Upload UI Components**
   - File input with "Choose File" button
   - Drag-and-drop area with visual indicators
   - Image counter display (0/5 format)
   - File type and size restrictions clearly displayed

2. **Form Validation**
   - Required fields marked with "*" asterisk
   - Client-side validation prevents submission without required fields

3. **Upload Area Features**
   - Supports drag-and-drop functionality
   - Visual feedback for upload area interactions
   - Clear file format restrictions (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF)
   - File size limit (5MB per file)
   - Maximum file count (5 files)

## Console Logging Analysis

### Expected Upload Process Logs
Based on the logging setup, the following console messages should appear during image upload:

- üîÑ **Process start indicators**: Upload initiation
- üìÅ **File processing**: File validation and preparation
- üöÄ **Upload progress**: File transfer to Supabase storage
- ‚úÖ **Success indicators**: Successful upload completion
- ‚ùå **Error indicators**: Upload failures or validation errors
- üìä **Analytics**: Upload statistics and performance metrics

### Current Status
- Console monitoring successfully configured
- No upload logs captured during testing due to authentication limitations
- Framework ready to capture and analyze upload process logs

## Authentication Testing Attempts

### Email/Password Login
- **Email**:dearjm@icloud.com
- **Password**:bk223978

### Google OAuth
- **Process**: Successfully redirected to Google OAuth
- **Limitation**: Cannot complete without actual Google account access
- **URL**: accounts.google.com authentication flow initiated

## Recommendations

### For Complete Upload Testing

1. **Authentication Setup**
   - Provide valid test account credentials
   - Or implement test authentication bypass for automated testing
   - Consider using Playwright's authentication state persistence

2. **Image Upload Flow Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Example of complete upload test (requires authentication)
   test('complete image upload flow', async ({ page }) => {
     // 1. Authenticate user
     await authenticateUser(page);

     // 2. Open post creation
     await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Í∏ÄÏì∞Í∏∞' }).click();

     // 3. Select apartment (Masteri Thao Dien)
     await selectApartment(page, 'Masteri Thao Dien');

     // 4. Select category
     await page.getByText('ÏßàÎ¨∏/ÎãµÎ≥Ä').click();

     // 5. Add content
     await page.getByPlaceholder('Î≥∏Î¨∏ *').fill('Test post with image');

     // 6. Upload test image
     await page.setInputFiles('input[type="file"]', 'test-image.png');

     // 7. Monitor upload logs
     const uploadLogs = await captureUploadLogs(page);

     // 8. Submit post
     await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Îì±Î°ùÌïòÍ∏∞' }).click();

     // 9. Verify post creation and image display
     await expect(page.getByText('Test post with image')).toBeVisible();
   });
   ```

3. **Test Image Creation**
   - Create actual test image files for upload testing
   - Test different file formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF)
   - Test file size limits (under/over 5MB)
   - Test multiple file uploads (up to 5 files)

4. **Upload Process Monitoring**
   - Verify files reach Supabase 'community-images' bucket
   - Monitor upload progress and completion
   - Test error handling for failed uploads
   - Validate image metadata extraction

## Upload Process Architecture

Based on code analysis, the upload process likely follows:

1. **File Selection/Drop** ‚Üí Validate file type and size
2. **Client Processing** ‚Üí Extract metadata, create thumbnails if needed
3. **Supabase Upload** ‚Üí Transfer to 'community-images' bucket
4. **Database Record** ‚Üí Store file references in community_post_images table
5. **UI Update** ‚Üí Show uploaded images in post preview
6. **Form Submission** ‚Üí Create post with associated images

## Conclusion

The image upload functionality appears to be well-implemented with:
- ‚úÖ Proper UI components and user guidance
- ‚úÖ File validation and restrictions
- ‚úÖ Integration with Supabase storage
- ‚úÖ Evidence of successful previous uploads
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging system ready for monitoring

**Main Limitation**: Complete testing requires authenticated user access to fully validate the upload-to-storage pipeline and capture the custom logging messages.

**Recommendation**: Provide test account credentials or implement authentication bypass for automated testing to complete the full upload flow validation and capture the console logs showing files reaching the Supabase storage bucket.
