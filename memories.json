Auth Helper: `validatedActionWithUser()` calls `getSessionUser()` from `/lib/auth.ts`\n4. Session Management: `getSessionUser()` uses SSR client, middleware refreshes sessions\n5. Database Layer: `createPost()` function in `/lib/data/community.ts`\n\n**Auth Flow:**\n- Middleware: Refreshes auth sessions on all routes\n- Action Helper: Validates auth before running server action \n- API Route: Directly checks `supabase.auth.getUser()` in POST handler\n- Both paths: Insert to `community_posts` table with `user_id`\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- Session sync between server/client contexts\n- RLS policies on `community_posts` table\n- Missing `status` field (added in recent commits)\n- Cookie handling differences between server action vs API route\n- Auth state timing in different contexts",

RLS policies are properly configured (added 2025-07-22)\n4. Debug functions exist: get_auth_uid(), debug_rls_context(), test_post_creation()\n5. Middleware runs on all routes and refreshes sessions\n\n**IDENTIFIED ISSUE:**\nPOST requests to API route return \"Authentication required\" - this indicates:\n- supabase.auth.getUser() is returning null/error in API context\n- This is NOT a database or RLS issue (those would give different errors)\n- This is a session/cookie handling issue in API routes vs server components\n\n**KEY FINDINGS:**\n1. API route uses createClient from server-api.ts\n2. Server actions use createClient from server.ts  \n3. Both use cookies() but have different cookie handling patterns\n4. API route has try/catch blocks for cookie setting errors\n5. Middleware refreshes sessions but API routes may not inherit this properly\n\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nSession cookies are not being properly passed/read in API route context, causing auth.getUser() to fail even when user is authenticated in browser.",
