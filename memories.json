API route uses createClient from server-api.ts\n2. Server actions use createClient from server.ts  \n3. Both use cookies() but have different cookie handling patterns\n4. API route has try/catch blocks for cookie setting errors\n5. Middleware refreshes sessions but API routes may not inherit this properly\n\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nSession cookies are not being properly passed/read in API route context, causing auth.getUser() to fail even when user is authenticated in browser.",
