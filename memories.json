API route uses createClient from server-api.ts\n2. Server actions use createClient from server.ts  \n3. Both use cookies() but have different cookie handling patterns\n4. API route has try/catch blocks for cookie setting errors\n5. Middleware refreshes sessions but API routes may not inherit this properly\n\n**ROOT CAUSE:**\nSession cookies are not being properly passed/read in API route context, causing auth.getUser() to fail even when user is authenticated in browser.",

CategorySidebar onClick → handleCategoryClick() → router.push(newUrl)\n2. CommunityPageClient useEffect detects searchParams changes → router.refresh()\n3. Server component re-fetches data with new filters\n\n**Potential Issues Found:**\n1. State sync timing issues between CategorySidebar and CommunityPageClient\n2. Multiple router operations happening simultaneously \n3. CommunityPageClient useEffect triggers router.refresh() on every searchParams change\n4. Sorting functionality working independently (SortSelector.tsx) - different implementation pattern\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- CategorySidebar: Direct router.push() with new URL\n- CommunityPageClient: useEffect → router.refresh() when URL changes\n- SortSelector: Same pattern as CategorySidebar but seems to work\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- No response on sidebar clicks\n- Not sorting properly\n- No filtering behavior",

Next.js App Router automatically re-renders server components when URL changes, so the manual refresh was redundant and harmful.\n\n**Testing Status:**\n- Lint errors resolved ✅\n- TypeScript compilation clean (excluding test files) ✅ \n- Development server running on port 3001 ✅\n- Debug logging added for troubleshooting ✅\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Remove debug logging for production\n- Test category clicking and sorting functionality\n- Verify URL parameter handling works correctly",

Migrating ApartmentAutocomplete would require:\n1. Changing form state structure (apartment_id string → LocationSearchResult object)\n2. Updating form validation logic\n3. Modifying form submission logic\n4. Risk of breaking post creation workflow\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\nKeep ApartmentAutocomplete.tsx as it's functional and actively used. While not as sophisticated as unified search, it serves its purpose without risk to existing functionality.\n\n**FINAL COUNT:**\n- Successfully removed: 6 obsolete files\n- Evaluated and kept: 2 files with active usage (VietnameseLocationSelector, ApartmentAutocomplete)",

SEARCH IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED: While the search UI components exist (UnifiedSearchBar, UnifiedSearchInterface), the actual content search functionality is NOT implemented in the community posts API endpoint (/app/api/community/posts/route.ts). The GET endpoint filters by city, apartmentId, category, sort but there is NO handling for the \"search\" query parameter that the frontend sends via handleContentSearch.\n\n3. SEARCH FLOW: Frontend correctly sets \"search\" URL param via handleContentSearch() -> /community page renders with searchParams -> CommunityPageClient gets posts via server-side getPostsWithLikeStatus() -> but this function doesn't support text search parameter.\n\n4. MISSING LINK: The searchPostsWithLocation() function exists in data layer (line 696-787 in community.ts) but is never called. It has proper textSearch implementation using search_vector column.\n\n5. ARCHITECTURE: Well-structured with proper data layer abstraction, TypeScript types, image management, but search integration is incomplete.",

ApartmentSelector (community page) - Simple Select component that worked reliably\n2. ApartmentAutocomplete (new post dialog) - Complex Popover+Command with portal conflicts in Dialog\n\nROOT CAUSE: ApartmentAutocomplete had portal rendering conflicts when used inside Dialog components, causing unreliable behavior where it only worked after \"pre-warming\" with apartment selection on community page first.\n\nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n1. Created ApartmentSelectorForDialog component based on reliable ApartmentSelector\n2. Replaced ApartmentAutocomplete with ApartmentSelectorForDialog in NewPostDialog\n3. Maintained exact same interface compatibility: onApartmentSelect(id: string) and value: string\n4. Removed complex Popover/Command state management issues\n\nTECHNICAL LESSON: When components behave inconsistently, especially with portal-based UI libraries like Radix UI, simpler solutions often work better than complex ones. Portal conflicts in nested components (Popover inside Dialog) are common sources of reliability issues.\n\nFILES CHANGED:\n- /components/community/ApartmentSelectorForDialog.tsx (new)\n- /app/community/_components/NewPostDialog.tsx (updated import and component usage)\n\nRESULT: Both apartment selectors now behave identically and work without pre-selection requirements.",
