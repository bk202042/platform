# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing React errors when authenticated users try to perform post-authentication actions such as posting properties or interacting with community features. These errors are typically related to hydration mismatches between server-side and client-side authentication states, causing React to throw minified errors (commonly error #185) and preventing users from successfully completing authenticated actions. This feature will focus on fixing authentication-related issues to ensure seamless user experience for authenticated users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want the application to maintain consistent authentication state between server and client, so that I don't experience hydration errors when performing actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent authentication state between server-side rendering and client-side hydration
2. WHEN a user is authenticated on the server THEN the client SHALL receive the same authentication state without causing hydration mismatches
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update both server and client states synchronously
4. WHEN there are authentication state discrepancies THEN the system SHALL resolve them gracefully without throwing React errors
5. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL prevent authentication-related hydration mismatches

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to perform post-authentication actions without encountering React errors, so that I can successfully use all application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user creates a post THEN the system SHALL process the action without React errors
2. WHEN an authenticated user likes or comments on content THEN the system SHALL handle the interaction seamlessly
3. WHEN an authenticated user uploads images THEN the system SHALL process the upload without authentication-related errors
4. WHEN an authenticated user navigates between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication state consistently
5. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle renewal or re-authentication gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling for authentication issues, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly Korean error messages
2. WHEN authentication tokens are invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication with clear instructions
3. WHEN network issues affect authentication THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN users need to re-authenticate THEN the system SHALL preserve their intended action for completion after login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust authentication state management, so that authentication works reliably across all application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing authentication checks THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns across all components
2. WHEN managing authentication state THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions and state inconsistencies
3. WHEN handling authentication in server components THEN the system SHALL properly integrate with client-side state
4. WHEN authentication state updates THEN the system SHALL notify all dependent components efficiently
5. WHEN debugging authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless authentication experience across different devices and browsers, so that I can access the application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication state appropriately
2. WHEN using different browsers THEN the system SHALL handle authentication consistently
3. WHEN cookies are disabled THEN the system SHALL provide alternative authentication mechanisms
4. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL handle re-authentication smoothly
5. WHEN authentication data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want protected routes to work correctly, so that I can access authenticated features without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify authentication without causing React errors
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with proper return URL handling
3. WHEN already authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow access to protected routes immediately
4. WHEN authentication status is uncertain THEN the system SHALL resolve the status before rendering protected content
5. WHEN middleware processes authentication THEN the system SHALL coordinate with client-side authentication state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want authentication-related loading states to be handled properly, so that I have a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is being verified THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN authentication state is loading THEN the system SHALL prevent premature rendering of authenticated content
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to the authenticated state
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show error states with recovery options
5. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL disable actions that require authentication
