# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the UI improvements for the existing community feature. The improvements focus on enhancing user experience through better visual design, improved interactions, responsive layouts, and enhanced functionality while maintaining the Korean language interface and apartment-centric approach. The design builds upon the existing Next.js App Router structure with Supabase backend and shadcn/ui components.

- Enhanced component composition with better separation of concerns
- Improved state management for real-time interactions
- Better error handling and loading states
- Enhanced responsive design patterns
- Optimized data fetching strategies
