- [ ] 18. Create comprehensive testing suite
- ✅ **Senior Engineer's Guide (MANDATORY):** This is our primary defense against the kind of latent bug that caused our final build error. The focus is not just on UI components. We **must** create a robust suite of unit tests for our core business logic.
  - **Action Item:** Create a new folder structure `/lib/validation/__tests__` and `/lib/data/__tests__`.
  - **Action Item:** For every existing validation function (e.g., `validatePropertyListing`), create a corresponding test file. Test for valid data, invalid data (e.g., incorrect `GeoJSONPoint` structure), and missing fields.
  - **Action Item:** For data transformation functions, write tests that assert the output shape is what you expect.
  - Write unit tests for all enhanced components
  - Add integration tests for user interaction flows
  - Implement accessibility testing with automated tools
  - Add responsive design tests for different screen sizes
  - Create end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
